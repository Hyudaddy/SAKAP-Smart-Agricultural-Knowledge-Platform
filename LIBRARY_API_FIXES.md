# Library API Fixes Summary

## Issues Identified

1. **Authentication Error**: The file upload API requires authentication, but the frontend was not sending the authentication token in the request headers.

2. **Poor Error Handling**: The frontend was not properly handling HTTP errors, leading to "Unexpected end of JSON input" errors when the server returned non-JSON responses.

3. **Missing Uploads Directory**: The uploads directory did not exist, which could cause issues when trying to save uploaded files.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed Authentication in Frontend
Updated the `ManageELibrary.tsx` component to include the authentication token in all API requests:
- Added `Authorization: Bearer <token>` header to POST, PUT, and DELETE requests
- Retrieved the token from localStorage using `localStorage.getItem('authToken')`

### 2. Improved Error Handling
Enhanced error handling in all API calls:
- Added checks for `response.ok` before attempting to parse JSON
- Added proper error messages that include HTTP status and response text
- Implemented more descriptive error alerts for users

### 3. Created Uploads Directory
Created the missing `backend/uploads` directory to ensure file uploads can be saved properly.

## Code Changes

### ManageELibrary.tsx
- Updated `handleAddResource()` to include authentication token
- Updated `handleEditResource()` to include authentication token
- Updated `handleDeleteResource()` to include authentication token
- Added proper error handling for all API calls

## Testing

To test the fixes:
1. Ensure you're logged in as an admin user
2. Navigate to the Manage E-Library page
3. Try to add a new resource with a file
4. Verify that the resource is successfully uploaded and appears in the library
5. Try editing and deleting resources to ensure those functions work as well

## Additional Notes

- The backend API is correctly configured with proper authentication middleware
- The Supabase database connection is working properly
- File upload functionality is fully implemented with proper validation and error handling
- The system now properly handles both successful operations and error conditions
