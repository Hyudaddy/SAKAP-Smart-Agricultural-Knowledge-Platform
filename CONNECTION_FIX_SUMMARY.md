# Connection Error Fix Summary

## Problem Identified
The frontend application was experiencing connection errors when trying to communicate with the backend API:
- `Failed to load resource: net::ERR_CONNECTION_REFUSED`
- `TypeError: Failed to fetch`

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by a port mismatch between the frontend configuration and the backend server:
- Frontend was configured to connect to port 5015 (via VITE_API_BASE_URL in .env)
- Backend was running on port 5030 (configured in backend/.env)

## Solution Implemented
1. Updated the frontend environment configuration file (`frontend/.env`) to point to the correct backend port:
   - Changed `VITE_API_BASE_URL` from `http://localhost:5015/api` to `http://localhost:5030/api`
   - Changed `VITE_BACKEND_URL` from `http://localhost:5011` to `http://localhost:5030`

2. Restarted both frontend and backend servers to apply the configuration changes.

## Verification
After the fix, the connection errors should be resolved:
- Authentication API calls (login, register) should work correctly
- All API endpoints should be accessible
- File upload and download functionality should operate normally

## Additional Notes
- The proxy configuration in `vite.config.ts` was already correctly set to port 5030
- The backend server is confirmed running on port 5030
- All services should now communicate properly without connection errors

## Testing
To verify the fix:
1. Open the application at http://localhost:8080
2. Try to log in or register a new user
3. Navigate to the E-Library sections
4. Test file upload functionality in the admin Manage Library section
