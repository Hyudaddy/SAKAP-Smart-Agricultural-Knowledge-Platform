# Library Likes Feature - Implementation Guide

## Overview
This document provides a comprehensive guide to the implementation of the likes feature for the E-Library system in the SAKAP Agricultural Assistance Platform. This feature allows users to like library content and provides administrators with engagement metrics.

## Features Implemented

### 1. Database Schema Changes
- Added `like_count` column to the `library_content` table
- Created new `library_content_likes` table to track user likes
- Added indexes for performance optimization
- Created ID generation functions and sequences

### 2. Backend API
- Implemented RESTful endpoints for library content management
- Added endpoints for view, download, and like tracking
- Created service layer methods for all library operations
- Implemented authentication for like functionality

### 3. Frontend Integration
- Updated Admin Library Management interface to display real data
- Enhanced User-facing Library interface with like functionality
- Implemented view and download tracking
- Added loading and error states

## Implementation Details

### Database Schema

#### Updated `library_content` Table
The existing `library_content` table was updated to include a `like_count` column:

```sql
ALTER TABLE library_content 
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS like_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0;
```

#### New `library_content_likes` Table
A new table was created to track which users have liked which content:

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS library_content_likes (
  id VARCHAR(20) PRIMARY KEY,
  content_id VARCHAR(20) REFERENCES library_content(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  user_id VARCHAR(20) REFERENCES users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW(),
  UNIQUE(content_id, user_id)
);
```

### Backend Implementation

#### LibraryService Methods
The [LibraryService](file://d:\sakap-agri-assist-main\backend\src\services\libraryService.ts#L30-L376) class was enhanced with new methods:

1. `hasUserLikedContent(contentId, userId)` - Check if user has liked content
2. `addLikeToContent(contentId, userId)` - Add like to content
3. `removeLikeFromContent(contentId, userId)` - Remove like from content
4. `getLikeCount(contentId)` - Get like count for content
5. `incrementLikeCount(id)` - Increment like count
6. `decrementLikeCount(id)` - Decrement like count

#### ContentController Endpoints
The [ContentController](file://d:\sakap-agri-assist-main\backend\src\controllers\ContentController.ts#L4-L209) was updated with new endpoints:

1. `GET /api/content/library/:id` - Get specific library content by ID
2. `PUT /api/content/library/:id/view` - Increment view count
3. `PUT /api/content/library/:id/download` - Increment download count
4. `PUT /api/content/library/:id/like` - Toggle like for content (requires authentication)

### Frontend Implementation

#### ManageELibrary Component
The [ManageELibrary.tsx](file://d:\sakap-agri-assist-main\frontend\src\pages\ManageELibrary.tsx) component was updated to:
- Fetch real data from the backend API instead of using mock data
- Display actual view, download, and like counts
- Implement loading and error states
- Maintain existing UI/UX patterns

#### ELibrary Component
The [ELibrary.tsx](file://d:\sakap-agri-assist-main\frontend\src\pages\ELibrary.tsx) component was enhanced to:
- Fetch real data from the backend API
- Implement actual like functionality with API integration
- Track view counts when content is accessed
- Track download counts when content is downloaded
- Show visual feedback for liked content
- Implement loading and error states

## Testing the Implementation

### Prerequisites
1. Development server running (`npm run dev`)
2. Database properly configured
3. API endpoints accessible

### Test Script
A test script is included to verify the implementation:

```bash
cd d:\sakap-agri-assist-main
node test-library-likes.js
```

### Manual Testing
1. Visit http://localhost:8081/library (User-facing E-Library)
2. Visit http://localhost:8081/manage-library (Admin Library Management)
3. Log in as an admin user
4. Like some content and see the like counts update in real-time

## Security Considerations

1. **Authentication**: Like functionality requires user authentication
2. **Authorization**: Only authenticated users can like content
3. **Data Integrity**: Unique constraint prevents duplicate likes
4. **Transaction Safety**: Rollback mechanism if operations fail

## Performance Optimizations

1. **Database Indexes**: Added indexes on frequently queried fields
2. **Efficient Queries**: Optimized queries for fetching content and user likes
3. **Caching**: Client-side caching of user likes to reduce API calls

## Future Enhancements

1. **Batch Operations**: Implement batch fetching of user likes
2. **Pagination**: Add pagination for large libraries
3. **Sorting**: Add sorting options by engagement metrics
4. **Analytics Dashboard**: Enhanced analytics for administrators
5. **Notifications**: Notify content creators of likes

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **API Endpoints Not Found**
   - Ensure the development server is running
   - Check that the backend is listening on the correct port
   - Verify the API routes are properly configured

2. **Database Connection Issues**
   - Verify Supabase credentials in environment variables
   - Check network connectivity to the database
   - Ensure the database schema is properly initialized

3. **Authentication Errors**
   - Ensure JWT tokens are properly configured
   - Verify user roles are correctly assigned
   - Check that the auth middleware is properly implemented

### Debugging Steps

1. Check the browser console for frontend errors
2. Check the terminal output for backend errors
3. Verify API responses using tools like Postman
4. Check database records to ensure data is being stored correctly

## Conclusion

The library likes feature has been successfully implemented, providing users with the ability to engage with library content and administrators with valuable engagement metrics. The implementation follows best practices for security, performance, and maintainability.
